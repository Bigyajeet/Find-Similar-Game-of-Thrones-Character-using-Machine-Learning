# Find-Similar-Game-of-Thrones-Character-using-Machine-Learning
 A machine learning project that aims to find similarities among Game of Thrones characters. i have  dive into the techniques used in this project  to process and visualize high-dimensional data, providing insights into the application of machine learning in character analysis.

## Future Work

* Explore other similarity metrics and clustering algorithms.
* Incorporate character metadata (e.g., house, allegiances, death status) to see its impact on similarity.
* Experiment with more advanced NLP techniques like Word Embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe, BERT) for richer character representations.
* Develop a more interactive visualization tool.
